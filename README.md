# HUANG_BMI500_HW7_AKI

The pdf of the report contains the methodology for the feature extraction and database query. The patient_aki.csv table was created by querying the MIMIC-III database using the AKI.sql script. The patient_aki.csv file was then loaded as a dataframe into the HW7.py script for the clustering, classification, and prediction analysis.
